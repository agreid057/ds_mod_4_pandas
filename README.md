# ds_mod_4_pandas
Homework for week 4 of the data analysis bootcamp 2024 - Pandas

In this Challenge I used pandas to clean, create, and manipulate dataframes.
I then analyzed the test score data from 15 different school and drew conclusions based on the data.

All required files are located in the PyCitySchools folder. The analysis is in a .md file.
