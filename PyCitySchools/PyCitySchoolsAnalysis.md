# Conclusions

## conclusion 1.
    When looking at the Bottom Performing Schools dataframe it seems like the charter schools are underperforming based on overall passing percent. This doenst look quite right, if you take a look at any of the other columns you can see that realative to the total number of students the charter schools seem to out perform the distric schools based on individual math and reading socres. This could be beacuse the sample sizes are smaller compared to some of the district schools, causing some sort of skewing in the data.

## conclusion 2.
    By looking at the Per Schools Summary you can see that the charter schools are much smaller, have less total funding, and less funding per student. Despite all of these differences the charter schools consistantly produce higher average math and reading scores, all of the averages in the 80th percentile. You could conclude that even if the charter schools don't have the same funding as the district schools having a smaller student population trends twords better test scores.

## conclusion 3.
    Looking at the Per School Summary dataframe again there is a clear different in math and reading scores. No matter if the student attends a charter school or a district school the average math score will be less than the average reading score. There is a difference in charter school and district school scores, generally the charter schools socres will be pretty close, but with the district schools there is a larger separation in the scores. This could be due the the number of students at the schools, the smaller the schools/classes the better scores will be.
